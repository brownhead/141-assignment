# CS 141 Progress Report

## Strategy

### Alignment Algorithm

**To be written...**

### Sorting Algorithm

We plan to use the built-in Python `sort()` function as it is extremely unlikely that we can create an implementation in Python that would outperform the finely tuned, compiled code that `sort()` uses. The algorithm that `sort()` uses is called timsmort and is detailed in [this blog post](http://www.hatfulofhollow.com/posts/code/timsort/index.html).

## Dividing Work

In order to divide the work we first seperated the assignment into discrete tasks. We defined several interfaces and contracts that would allow meaningful work on pieces of code that depend on other (as of yet unfinished) pieces of code.

The GitHub issue tracker is being used to keep track of these tasks.

## What you have accomplished to date

**Should be completed shortly before submission.**
